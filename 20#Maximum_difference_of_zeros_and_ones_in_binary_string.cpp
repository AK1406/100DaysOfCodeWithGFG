/*
Maximum difference of zeros and ones in binary string.

Given a binary string S consisting of 0s and 1s. The task is to find the maximum difference of the number of 0s and the number of 1s (number of 0s â€“ number of 1s) in the substrings of a string.

Note: In the case of all 1s, the answer will be -1.

Example 1:

Input : S = "11000010001" 
Output : 6 
Explanatio: From index 2 to index 9, 
there are 7 0s and 1 1s, so number 
of 0s - number of 1s is 6. 
Example 2:

Input: S = "111111"
Output: -1
Explanation: S contains 1s only 

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S|)
